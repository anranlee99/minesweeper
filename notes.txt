**App's Functionality**

Disclaimer: I plan to steal all artwork necessary unless that is not allowed. 
I'm really no artist so that will become the new greatest challenge if so. 

RULES
- minesweeper's objective is to clear every tile that is not a bomb, and to not click on the bombs
- each tile that is adjacent to a bomb should display how many bombs it is touching when it is uncovered

MVP
- As a user, I want to see the game follow minesweeper's rules
- As a user, I want to click a reset button to start the game over.
- As a user, I NEEEEED to see the sunglasses when I win. 
- As a user, I want to see flags work properly. 
    -When the game is over, I should see bombs go red or have X's if I lost
    -See the correct/incorrect flags when the game is over
- As a user, I want to see the count of remaining bombs. 


Icebox Features (In order of likelihood to be implemented)
- As a user, I want to be able to chord (game sucks to play without)
    -middle mouse button for chord click?
- As a user, I would like a 'no corners' mode, aka no bombs in the corners. 
- As a user, I want to see the game clock. 
- As a user, I want to see an optional menu on the stats (height, width, density, etc)

(probably won't get to this one, the logic is insane)
- As a user, it would be great if there was a 'no guess' mode. 
    -In minesweeper, you can encounter scenarios where you have to guess.
    -Some enjoy the thrill but I find it emotionally crushing (I am unlucky)


**Psuedocode**
When we a start a game of minesweeper:
- Initialize an array either with the default size and bomb density, or the custom inputs

- Initialize an array of the numbers underneath(?)
    -Method 1: On click, calculate the adjacent squares, generate the images accordingly
    -Method 2: Generate the bombs/numbers board underneath, and 'reveal' on click
    NOTE: leaning towards Method 1 because I am hoping the flags will stay on the board
    and for the bombs to reveal if you didn't flag. So it will not always reveal the same thing

- I will need functions to generate the bombs, maybe solutions, and an init function which the 
    reset button will also listen for

- I liked the program flow of tictactoe a lot, but since I really want to implement a chord click,
  I might as well reuse the code/logic needed for that for functions that will be called on click.
- I need many listeners, including a left click (open tile), right click (flag), reset btn, custom imput btn
- Need some kind of logic to implement the chord click on a revealed square, possibly if/else 
  nested in my listeners, which will then execute a different function. 

While there are tiles that are not flagged, revealed, or bombs:
- just listen for inputs basically. 
- if a covered tile is clicked, reveal it. 
    -if it's a bomb, lose, reveal all bombs, right/wrong flags, change the smiley to dead smiley
- if a revealed tile is clicked, trigger chord click function
    -if adjacentBombsCount === adjacentFlagsCount, trigger the reveal function on all adjacent tiles
    that are not flags.
- if a covered tile is right clicked, flag it if it's unflagged, unflag if it's flagged
- if an uncovered tile is right clicked, do nothing


When the game is over:
-reveal all times that are bombs, and not flagged
-if a tile is flagged, show right/wrong
-do not uncover all tiles
-display win smiley, loss smiley, stop listening for clicks except for input button and reset button

** Application State Data **
- Bomb array, have not decided the best data format yet, probably a 2D array since I will need 
- An array for the unopened squares
- An array for the squares around a bomb to display the numbers

** Application Constant Data **
-game state (win, loss, neither(playing))
- A count of the bombs
-A count of the flags, and the amount of bombs to display (bombs minus flags)
-define null for adjacentBombsCount && adjacentFlagsCount (?)
    -need to try the code to know what is better


** Program Flow **
The game should start, and not have the clock running until the first move - DONE

-What should happen on a move
    -If the tile is not opened, then open the square
        -if the tile is a bomb, then lose
        -if the tile is a flag, do nothing
        -if the tile is open, do the chord function
        
    DILEMMA: 
    I could generate the numbers underneath the unopened tiles two ways:
    1) calculate and generate them all, then "reveal" them on open
    2) calculate and generate them on when the tile is opened
